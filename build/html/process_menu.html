<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Node Search (float)</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>This value is the distance nodes will search the corresponding edge image for connections to other nodes. Note that this value is scaled corresponding to the xy_scale/z_scale parameters. (As in, if you set xy_scale/z_scale correctly, then treat this as a real-value, such as microns, for your image).</p></li>
<li><p>Note this value is 0 by default, which will only connect nodes that edges literally pass through.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Edge Reconnection Distance (float)</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>This value is the distance edges will dilate (‘get inflated’). Note that this value is scaled corresponding to the xy_scale/z_scale parameters. (As in, if you set xy_scale/z_scale correctly, then treat this as a real-value, such as microns, for your image).</p></li>
<li><p>The point of this parameter is if your segmented edges are not continious structures, due to having holes from imaging/segmenting artifacts. Edges that are totally discrete in 3D space (ie, not touching), as one might expect, will not join together nodes through that pathway. Blowing them up will fill those holes.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep in mind that all edges get blown up - so if I have two edges that are ten microns apart, entering a value of 5 (microns) here will cause them to merge.</p></li>
<li><p>This method does NOT erode. It only dilates! This also enables edges to search a bit further than the Node Search parameter suggests, because they can then enter a node’s search space!</p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, there is an inherent trade off in using dilation to fill hole artifacts, since they also risk merging nearby edges that shouldn’t be merged. Use at your own risk!</p></li>
<li><p>(FYI if there are holes I do like to use this param a little bit, however a more elegant solution is to independently dilate, then erode the edges before starting this method). It’s difficult to create a totally smooth segmentation throughout small, filamentous objects</p></li>
<li><p>Note this value is 0 by default, and shouldn’t be anything if your edges don’t have hole artifacts, or those were already corrected (via dilating them yourself, with optional erosion).</p></li>

<li><p>Note that centroids calculated on downsampled images have to be approximated to the upsampled version, so they may not correspond <em>perfectly</em>, although they will generally be close enough.</p></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Warning: for any downsample on an image containing small nodes, if those nodes’ smallest dimension is smaller than this down factor, they run the risk of being kicked out of the downsampled image, which means their centroid will not be found.</dt><dd><ul>

<li><p>Note: This occurs after NetTracer3D has discretized (split up) the edges. It functions similarly but NOT the same as removing the trunk from the network in-post. It will instead remove the highest-volume (literally, the largest) edge.</p></li>
<li><p>Meanwhile, removing the trunk from the network in post takes out the most interconnected edge. Many times this will have the same result, but not always. Just make sure you are using the version of trunk removal that you want.</p></li>

<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Use GPU:</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Has NetTracer3D attempt to use the GPU for the distance transform step.</p></li>
<li><p>If fast dilation is enabled and your system runs out of VRAM doing the distance transform, this algorithm is set up to iteratively retry the operation with successive downsamples, until it finds one that fits in your GPU. This downsample is only temporary - NetTracer3D is attempting to find seed kernels to reassign labels in a full-sized binary dilation.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that this of course runs the risk of removing nodes from your array, as described in parameter 7 (Use parameter 7 for more direct control over this behavior).</p></li>
<li><p>If the distance transform fails for any othe reason on GPU, it will by default be computed on CPU instead. The CPU version will never attempt to downsample.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that the above only applies to fast dilation. Not using fast dilation will just attempt to use the GPU for the distance transform once, then move on the CPU if memory runs out.</p></li>

<dt>Update Node/Edge in NetTracer3D:</dt><dd><ul class="simple">

<li><p>For the edges particularly, this may have them be reloaded with a version that looks a bit chopped up and altered, albiet mostly the same.</p></li>

<li><p>Nodes are expanded based on their search distance. This expansion is accomplished through the use of a distance transform that assigns outer ‘shell’ regions a label corresponding to the internal labeled node they are closest to.</p></li>
<li><p>The search region is used to split the edges up. Edges outside the search region become ‘outer edges’, while those inside the search region become ‘inner edges’. The edge pieces aquire unique labels, conveying their identity.</p></li>
<li><p>(If not using param 5), outer edges are still dilated a single time to force them to once more overlap the search region by a single voxel. The search region for every node can then be evaluated for what ‘outer edge’ it interacts with.</p></li>
<li><p>Since inner edges potentially course through many search regions, an additional step is required to find their node-to-node connections. The border of the search region is acquired via the skimage find_boundaries method. These node borders can be extracted and used to isolate the ‘inner edge pieces’ that exist inside of them, which all aquire unique label IDs. We can dilate those inner edge pieces once to evaluate which nodes touch them.</p></li>
<li><p>The group of edges that each node interacts with can then be sorted through. Any nodes that interact with the same edge are connected.</p></li>

<li><p>The psuedo-3D kernel method aims to combine serial dilations in both the XY and XZ planes to simulate a 3D dilation. First, the distance to search in the X vs Y vs Z dimensions is determined based on the scalings for each respective dim.</p></li>
<li><p>This distance is used to generate dilation kernels that expand the pixels in the image until they encompass that search region. For the XY plane, this kernel is a circle (with the search distance being its radius), since NetTracer3D assumes the x and y scalings to always be equal. For the XZ plane, if the x and z scaling are not equal, this kernel is an ellipse instead, with the short axis being the shorter search distance, and the long axis being the longer search distance. (Doing it this way means we can ignore normalizing resolutions).</p></li>
<li><p>The image is then chopped up along the Z-axis to allow 2D dilations to be performed in parallel until all the XY planes have been dilated via the openCV2 dilate algorith, a <em>quite</em> optimized function: <a class="reference external" href="https://opencv24-python-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_morphological_ops/py_morphological_ops.html">https://opencv24-python-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_morphological_ops/py_morphological_ops.html</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Likewise, a copy of the image is chopped up along the Y-axis to allow 2D dilations in parallel until all the XZ planes have been dilated via the openCV2 dilate algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>These outputs are combined to produce the psuedo-3D dilation.</p></li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul class="simple">
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>There are few things that must be noted about this method:</dt><dd><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>In the instance that an array is 2D, this method always hands it off to a distance transform instead. This is because most of the distance transform algos are pretty good in 2D, even faster than 2D dilation in many cases.</p></li>
<li><p>In the instance that the search region is explicitly 1 voxel in all dimensions, this method hands it off to the scipy.ndimage.binary_dilation() method (<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.binary_dilation.html">https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.binary_dilation.html</a>) for dilation with a simple 3x3x3 cubic kernel. While this method can be slow, it generally handles small dilation with simple kernels okay.</p></li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Note</strong> the psuedo-3D kernel method is actually rather bad at handling dilation regions much larger than the original node. I previously had an alternative to recursively call this method to preform serial dilations that handled this, but removed it after it became redundant compared to the distance transform method, since the psuedo-3D kernels produce large error with large dilations anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>The psuedo 3D kernel would essentially be like turning these voxels: ········· into these ++++++++ en masse.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Distance Transform method:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Eventually I just opted to add a distance transform to get perfect dilations in-leui of true 3D kernel-based dilating, since the scipy 3D dilation option was already slow anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>A distance transform converts an image into a map that conveys how far each non-zero pixel is from zero.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>If we invert an image, we can obtain this distance transform on the inversion, which tells us how far away each background voxel is from our objects. This is done with the scipy.ndimage.distance_transform_edt() method:</p></li>
<li><p>This dt can be turned into essentially a perfect binary dilation via boolean indexing.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The downside is this method can be slow (although its slowness is independent of dilation size). For example, on images ~3 GB it might take twenty minutes to finish depending on your CPU.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore it exists as an option when we want to ensure accuracy, whereas psuedo-3D kernels are better for small dilations when we don’t care about small error regions, or when we just want to know if other objects are in the general vicinity.</p></li>
<li><p>This cartoon demonstrates how these algorithms work:</p></li>
</ul>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/process3.png"><img alt="Dilation Explained" src="_images/process3.png" style="width: 800px;" />
</a>
<p><em>Top left: Example of an object (cyan sphere) with its expansion kernel (red) for a small psuedo-3D kernel dilation. This isn’t exactly what the output looks like, instead imagine if these kernels were applied on every single voxel in the image. To the right is what this kernel would look like with a large dilation in a space with different scalings. Applying this one would produce greater error, since the regions ‘diagonal’ to the sphere would inevitably be excluded. In the bottom is this same scenario but demonstrated with a distance transform, which more or less gives a perfect expansion.</em></p>
<p><strong>If Preserving Labels:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If we are interested in preserving labels, we do an additional step that I refer to as ‘smart dilate’.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Essentially, the same binary dilation as above is determined.</p></li>
<li><p>If we did the distance transform method, we also have it return the ‘indices’ (of the distance transform of the inverted array), which populates each index in the array with the index of the background value it was closest to. Note that this data structure is more cumbersome than just a distance transform. It occupies 3x as much RAM. But we can use it to essentially query any index in the array and see what ‘node’ it belongs to, since in our inverted image, the nodes became the background.</p></li>
<li><p>The dilated regions are taken by subtracting out the original binary nodes from the binary dilated image. These shell regions are split up and paralellized across all CPU cores.</p></li>
<li><p>We then search through the indices of all the shell regions, get the index of the node it ‘belongs’ to from the distance transform index image, find the label of said node, and finally reassign the binary index in the dilated image to be its proper label instead.</p></li>
<li><p>The chunks are recombined to get the label-dilated array.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Note that if fast dilation (pseudo-3D kernels) is being used, and this method runs out of VRAM while using the GPU, it will downsample inverted nodes image and attempt to get the distance transform again. It will do this until the GPU manages to produce a distance transform, and after the dilated (with +1 search region in this instance) image in the downsampled image is found, it will be upsampled. Then, the full-sized binary, dilated image that we got earlier will be used to boolean-index the image we just upsampled, producing the final output.</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming no nodes are lost during the downsample, the output is ostensibly the same as doing it on the full sized image. This is essentially because we are using the downsampled image with distance transform to approximate a ‘nearest label map’ which can be applied to the upsample image, with the only difference being some minor margin errors between nodes.</p></li>
<li><p>However if any nodes have a dimension smaller than the downsample factor the system attempts to use (which will be told to you in the command window), they risk being removed from the downsampled image and therefore will not establish a ‘label territory’, which will cause them to be lost.</p></li>
<li><p>As a result, this behavior is not good for large images with rather small nodes. In such a case, do not use fast dilation together with GPU.</p></li>
<li><p>The purpose of this method is that it offers a rather accelerated option for certain cases. For example, connectivity networks can be found with decent accuracy assuming the dilation is not significantly larger than the nodes, and that the nodes aren’t too small if downsampling occurs.</p></li>
<li><p>Note this GPU behavior will not occur with distance transforms. This is because we need to get a distance transform to compute the dilation in the first place, so a downsampled alternative cannot be really used to ‘seed’ a full sized dilation as a way to preserve speed.</p></li>
<li><p>In both cases if the GPU does fail for any reason (besides memory-related for fast dilation), the system will reattempt with CPU.</p></li>

<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>As a side note, erosion can be combined with dilation to preform something called an ‘Open’ or ‘Close’ operation.</dt><dd><ul>
<li><p>An Open operation is an erosion followed by an equivalent level of dilation, which can be a cheap way to split apart objects that are just barely touching, while also eliminating noise, although it can be a bit disfiguring on masks at large values.</p></li>
<li><p>A more useful operation is Close, which is a dilation followed by an equivalent erosion. The result will fuse together nearby objects while keeping the image mask a similar shape/size.

</ul>
<p><strong>If Using the Machine Learning Segmenter</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">

Any time chunks are mentioned below, presume these are the sizes.</p></li>

Positive training regions have their values from the feature maps fed to the random forest classifier as ‘good’ numbers while negative training regions have their values from the feature maps fed to the random forest classifier as ‘bad’ numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>When the volume is segmented, chunks are handed off to be converted into feature maps, and each voxel in the chunk shows its corresponding index in the feature map to the random forest classifier to determine whether it ought to be considered foreground.</p></li>
<li><p>When this process finishes, it places its output in Overlay2. Note that the Preview Segment method works similar, except it does not interrupt the user, instead initiating a parallel thread that processes chunks at the user’s Z-plane, near their mouse position.</p></li>

<li><p>The feature maps for the ‘Quick Model’ are as follows:</p></li>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The original image.</p></li>
<li><p>Gaussian Blurs for sigma values 1, 2, 4, 8 (obtained via scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter())</p></li>
<li><p>Difference of Gaussians for sigma values 1-2, 2-4, and 4-8.</p></li>
<li><p>The gradiant magnitude, obtained from scipy.ndimage.sobel() sobel kernels in each dimension.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The feature maps for ‘Detailed Model’ are computed using multiple scales and morphological operators:</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The original Image</p></li>
<li><p>Gaussian Blurs for sigma values 1, 2, 4, 8 (obtained via scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter())</p></li>
<li><p>Difference of Gaussians (DoG) for sigma values 1-2, 2-4, and 4-8.</p></li>
<li><p>Gaussian Gradient Magnitudes - Computed for each sigma value using scipy.ndimage.sobel() kernels in all three dimensions (x, y, z). Magnitude calculated as sqrt(gx² + gy² + gz²) for each Gaussian-smoothed image. Captures edge strength at multiple scales.</p></li>
<li><p>Laplacian of Gaussian - Second-order derivative features computed using scipy.ndimage.laplace(). Applied to each Gaussian-smoothed image at different sigma values. Detects blob-like structures and zero-crossings.</p></li>
<li><p>Largest Hessian Eigenvalue - Computes the largest eigenvalue of the 3x3 Hessian matrix at each voxel. Uses second-order derivatives (hxx, hyy, hzz, hxy, hxz, hyz) via scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter() with order parameters. Fully vectorized computation using numpy.linalg.eigvals() for all spatial locations simultaneously. Captures local curvature information and tubular/sheet-like structures.</p></li>
<li><p>Feature Normalization - Intensity features (original image, Gaussians, DoGs) are kept in raw form. Morphological features (gradients, Laplacians, Hessian eigenvalues) are normalized using z-score standardization. Normalization applied per-feature across all spatial dimensions to ensure balanced feature contributions.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In general, the quick model is preferable for images with good SNR, while the detailed model weights morphology harder and so is better for poor SNR but typically requires more training.</p></li>
<li><p>For RGB images, each channel is processed independently, meaning it requires 3x as many maps.</p></li>
<li><p>Training by 2D patterns simply uses 2D alternatives to the above described maps.</p></li>
<li><p>Training with GPU simply uses cupy methods to get the above described maps.</p></li>
<li><p>Note these feature maps are computed in parallel, so while chunk processing is done sequentially to preserve RAM (especially due to feature map bloat), some speed can be recouped by parellel computing of the maps themselves.</p></li>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>This algorithm computes a distance transform on the binary image, telling the computer what regions lie close to the background.</p></li>
<li><p>Like the other distance transforms in NetTracer3D, if the system runs out of VRAM computing the distance transform on GPU, it will reattempt with serial downsampling. This will ostensibly give the same output unless labeled objects have a dimension smaller than the downsample factor, after which they might be removed from the image. Do not use GPU if that may occur on this image.</p></li>
<li><p>These regions are then erroded based on the value ‘Proportion’ - Essentially for a proportion of 0.05 (default), only the internal distance values with in the top 5% of the set of all distance values will be kept, to be used as seed kernels for relabeling the image.</p></li>
<li><p>These seed kernels are assigned unique labels with the scipy.ndimage.label() method, before they are used to relabel the original binary image.</p></li>
<li><p>The relabelling (and ultimate watershed) from the kernels unto the binary image is then completed with the skimage watershed method.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>This algorithm can be a bit slow on large images. The ‘proportion’ param is a bit hard to select; therefore, smallest radius is the better option, if it is known (The measurement points can be used to obtain this value).

<li><p>If param 4 is enabled, the branchpoints are labeled, and any larger than the set value will be removed from the output array.</p></li>
<li><p>If param 5 is enabled, the branchpoints are dilated as described, in order to merge nearby branchpoints. The resulting branchpoints are relabeled.</p></li>
<li><p>The newly labeled branchpoint array is placed in the nodes channel to be used to make branchpoint networks.</p></li>

<li><p>The branch labeler starts with the same set of steps as ‘Process -&gt; Generate -&gt; Generate Nodes (From ‘Edge’ Vertices)’, so please see its section above for an outline of those steps.</p></li>
<li><p>Once branchpoint nodes are generated, however, they are used as a mask to break up the skeleton.</p></li>
<li><p>The broken skeleton pieces are labeled with the scipy.ndimage.label() method, which assigns nontouching objects unique label IDs. What results is (ideally) a skeleton piece with a unique ID within each branch.</p></li>
<li><p>The branches themselves then aquire the label of their branch piece via Smart Label. (see Process -&gt; Image -&gt; Neighbor Labels). The only caveat is that while GPU downsampling is not typically a big issue, it is generally advised to be avoided if encountered here, as the skeleton pieces themselves are not very amenable to downsampling. If you try to use the GPU and it wants to downsample, please use the CPU instead for this method or the results will likely not be accurate.</p></li>
<li><p>If param 3 is enabled, a morphological proximity network will be generated between the branches to find their neighbors. Louvain network community detection will be applied to group them. The average degree of each community will be aquired, and those above the threshold in param 4 will be collapsed to a single label.</p></li>

<li><p>A voronoi diagram turns the centroids into an image where labeled cells now represent the region closest to said centroid.</p></li>
<li><p>This can be used as an alternative way to define node neighborhoods, as opposed to using the distance transform, which can then be used for connectivity networks.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that the Voronoi diagram is limited to defining neighborhoods surrounding centroids, however, so the above only applies for nodes that are small or homogenous spheroids.</p></li>
<li><p>Voronoi diagrams have other uses in spatial mathematics but NetTracer3D only offers the option to generate one - it does not use it directly for anything.</p></li>
